#Tests

Some tests for `chalk-image`

##Running

For now, there's pretty much only one test. Just run `node test.js` in a terminal or cmd prompt window. 

 - If you wanna run in 16M or 256 color modes, run `node test.js 16` or `node test.js 256`.
 - If you wanna export it as a promise (this *won't* look any different just in the tests), run `node test.js true`
 - And, of course, if you wanna do both, just run `node test.js 256 true`.
